# Why my own page?
Hello fellow reader, today I'm happy to tell you that now I have my own web page.
## The blue mark check
Since the blue mark check was implemented with Twitter premium, the experience in the app for those who don't pay gets worse and worse, not only for the algorithm and exposure, but also for some missing features that are really useful for writing.
Things like *italics* and editing tweets are things that I found extremely useful, not only for writing fanfics, but also for any post that you want to write. Especially the editing feature, there are so many times that I tweeted something or uploaded some fic and had to deleted to correct a typo.
Also, one of the biggest problem that I have with twitter is that you can't write longer tweets. Yes, you can pay for that, but then you have another problem, the longer you make a tweet the less the algorithm is going to show it. There's also the possibility (I would say that is a fact, but I don't have any proof ) that they are training some AI with all the twitter content and I don't feel confortable with that either. (And I'm not going to mention how now Twitter is flooded with only fans bots and content farms that are powered by AI, how generative AI destroyed all social media is for another blog) .
## Now what?
Well, for now, I'm going to be posting all the fanfics that I wrote here, I hope that is a comfortable site for you to read and any suggestion is more than welcome. You are going to find in the "Home" tab the progress on the projects that I had, some of them are secret and will be revealed later this year (if everything goes well), and some of them are public like the progress in the chapters of the fanfics. Also, you can find opinion articles like this one on the "Blog" tab and maybe some reviews about what I read and watch (feel free to recommend any show or book that you like, I would love to get some new pieces of media to consume). I would try to publish one chapter and one blog per week, but I don't want to make any promises.
I would not be completely abandoning Twitter and would tweet every time I update a fanfic or publish a blog, read your replies and read what my mutuals are writing, but anything that has to do with writing is going to be up on this web page. Hope you find it useful and more comfortable to read than Twitter.
And also, this web page is not done, there is a lot of things that I would like to implement but this are the most important for now:
- I want to implement a chapter selector in the fanfics so you can select the chapter where you left it.
- I want to implement a light mode for the general page and a dark mode for the fanfic reader because I know that some people have trouble reading with dark / light mode and I want to let you choose which one you prefer.
- I want to implement a notification system so you can subscribe to a fanfic and receive an email every time I update said fic.
But this things are going to be implemented in the future, since this months were quite hectic.
I think there is nothing more to say, anything that you want to say to me you can do it in the reply section of the tweet, hope you have a nice week.
